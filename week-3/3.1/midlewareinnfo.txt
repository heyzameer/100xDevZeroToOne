/ In web frameworks like Express, middleware provides a powerful way to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses before they reach their intended destinations. It's a modular approach that allows you to chain together code blocks responsible for various tasks, adding flexibility and extensibility to your application.

// Key Concepts:

// Function: Each middleware is a function that receives three arguments: req (the HTTP request object), res (the HTTP response object), and next (a function that allows the middleware to pass control to the next middleware in the chain).
// Chain Execution: Middleware functions are executed in the order they're registered with the framework. You can chain multiple middleware to perform various operations in a specific sequence.
// Data Manipulation: You can modify the req and res objects to add data, process input, or change response headers and content.
// Control Flow: The next function allows you to decide whether to proceed to the next middleware or send a response immediately.


// Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects, as well as the
//app.use(express.json());
// middle ware added toevery route that going to use this json which returns a function so that why () other wise normally written app.use(thatfunction)
